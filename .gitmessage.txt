### A good commit message is broken up into 3 parts:

1. The What
2. The Why
3. The Where

--->

## 1. The What

  * This is your first line.
  * It completes the sentence, "This change in this commit will..."
  * It does not end in a period
  * It is no longer than 50 characters

--->

## 2. The Why:

  * This makes up most of the body.
  * linewrapped at 72 chars.
  * Why specifically and technically is this change being made?
  * If referencing details for which the files inside this commit provide
    context, also reference those files here as that information will be
    muddied in a squashed message.

## 3. The Where:

  i.e. Where can I find more information about this task?

  * Why the Jira ticket, of course! i.e. List all applicable Jira ticket.
    * Or github issue. Or whatever ticketing system.
  * You may list more than one ticket
  * Each ticket on its own line.
