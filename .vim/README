Couple things I forgot to mention about vim that I use a lot. marks. You can
mark a spot in your file to be able to come back to real easy like. m+mark name
(i.e. ma ) will mark the location of the cursor. Navigate, do other things, the
hit 'a and youâ€™ll be back at your mark.
The other thing that I use every once in a while is macros.
With `.` you can redo the last command, but if you want to redo the last
several commands together, that would be a macro.


Also, with vim if you want to open a file and jump to a specific line:
```sh
vim path/to/example.omg +123
```
Will open example.omg and your cursor will be on line 123
