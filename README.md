# .dotfiles

This is my home public home directory and all the things I need to set up a new system the way I like.
This started based off the excellent [.dotfiles by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
and has since grown.

## Installation

If you are setting up a new system, you can simply run:
```
/bin/bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gidgidonihah/.dotfiles/master/.install/init.sh)
```

If you would like to simply apply the dotfiles:
```
/bin/bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gidgidonihah/.dotfiles/master/.install/dotfiles.sh)
```
Please note that by default that script uses ssh to clone.
You may want to copy and use https if you don't have access.

## Personal TODO
